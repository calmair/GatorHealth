        <div class="panel-body">Clínica Martín-Baró is a student-organized free clinic operating Saturdays out of the Mission Neighborhood Centers, Inc. It is a collaboration between medical students and faculty from the UCSF School of Medicine, and undergraduates from the SFSU Latin@ Studies Department. We work together to serve while learning about the social and medical conditions facing immigrants. We provide a space for student volunteers to develop and strengthen a socio-economic analysis of the state of healthcare in the U.S, and an educational environment to create life-long advocates for underserved communities. We encourage, support and empower low-income students of color to pursue higher education (including but not limited to medical school) and a career that will benefit the needs of such communities</div>
